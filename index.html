            <p> Dr.<strong>Su Qi</strong> is a distinguished specialist in molecular biology and bioinformatics, with extensive experience in the 
gut microbiome and its relationship to human diseases. He received his PhD degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), and he is currently a 
Research Assistant Professor at Faculty of Medicine, CUHK, Hong Kong. </p>
                
            <p>He is committed to the molecular mechanism and treatment of digestive system diseases caused by intestinal flora and has published more than 50 SCI papers, 40 of which were published as the first or corresponding author in the 
<b><i>Lancet Infectious Diseases</i></b> (IF: 56.3), <b><i>Cell Host & Microbe</i></b> (IF: 30.3), <b><i>Lancet Microbe</i></b> (IF: 20.9), <b><i>Gut</i></b> (IF: 24.5), <b><i>Nature Microbiology</i></b> (IF: 20.5), 
<b><i>Nature Biotechnology</i></b> (IF: 33.1), <b><i>Nature Communications</i></b> (IF: 16.6), <b><i>Gut Microbes</i></b> (IF: 12.2), and <b><i>Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics</i></b> (IF: 7.6), and other internationally renowned journals. He cited more than 1000 times. The relevant achievements have been highly concerned by domestic and 
foreign peers, and have won the special Gold and Silver Awards of the Geneva International Invention Exhibition, DDW Outstanding Paper Award, KDDW Outstanding Academic Award, Micro-Ecology Newcomer Award, first prize of China Gut Conference, KDDW Youth Research Institute Award, etc. 
A number of patented achievements such as microbial metagenomic multi-disease monitoring and probiotic formula SIM01 have been successfully 
translated into the market.
